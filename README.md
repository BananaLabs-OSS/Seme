# Seme

Seme is a canonical semantic programming platform. Syntax is a projection,
mechanics are composable semantic modules, packages and runtimes are explicit
dependencies, and execution targets declare how faithfully they realize those
semantics.

Seme is target-independent. WebAssembly is the first-class execution target and
primary portability proof, not the semantic foundation or the only backend.

This repository starts at the independent bootstrap boundary. USIR remains the
research prototype and behavioral reference; it is not copied into Seme and is
not part of Seme's trusted build path.

## Bootstrap direction

```text
frozen Linux-amd64 seed
    -> Hex0 source
    -> A0 canonical byte/integer notation
    -> S0 readable bootstrap notation
    -> Seme Kernel v1 reader/executor
    -> human-authored Seme compiler
    -> self-hosted Seme compiler
```

Only the first seed is native machine code with auditable assembly source.
Substantial software belongs in readable Seme, not assembly.

## Current status

- Kernel v1 is being specified; it is not frozen.
- The initial Hex0 seed is independently executable on Linux amd64.
- No Go, Rust, C, C++, Python, LLVM, or language runtime is required to run the
  frozen seed.
- The seed's checked-in hexadecimal image reproduces the frozen executable
  byte-for-byte without a host assembler or linker.
- The Hex0 seed constructs A0, and two A0 generations reproduce byte-identical
  A0 executables.
- A0 constructs the first portable K0-P0 executor; arithmetic, local-state,
  looping control flow, and malformed-image conformance fixtures pass.
- K0-P1 adds isolated function frames, parameters, calls, and entry selection
  while retaining P0 execution compatibility.
- K0-P2 adds bounded byte buffers and capability-scoped arguments, filesystem
  reads, and filesystem writes; a portable program performs a byte-identical
  file copy.
- P1/P2 images receive whole-image structural preflight before execution,
  including unreachable code and branch-witness validation.
- The first portable K0 compiler consumes checked A0 byte source and reproduces
  the K0 executor byte-for-byte; artifact construction has begun moving above
  native assembly.
- The portable S0 compiler consumes readable decimal/directive source and
  reproduces its own K0 image byte-for-byte across two generated generations.
- New bootstrap compiler work can now be authored in S0 without editing
  assembly, hexadecimal source, or A0 byte streams.
- The symbolic S1 compiler derives function tables, named calls, labels,
  instruction counts, code sizes, and byte witnesses. Its checked construction
  image and two self-produced generations are byte-identical.
- The first S1-authored Kernel wire validator accepts canonical nested semantic
  envelopes and rejects malformed integer, ordering, identity, tag, bounds, and
  trailing-byte cases.
- The S1-authored G1 compiler turns readable semantic graph notation into
  canonical Kernel wire. Its Counter and finite Kernel meta-schema outputs are
  byte-identical to the earlier A0 constructions and pass the independent
  validator.
- The candidate K0 semantic module represents programs, functions, and stable
  instruction identities in canonical Kernel graphs. The first S1-authored
  semantic lowerer turns its checked return-42 graph into a portable K0 image,
  derives execution layout rather than storing it canonically, and the frozen
  executor returns 42.
- The K0 semantic lowerer now has canonical Seme source and reproduces itself:
  checked compiler A, self-produced B, and B-produced C are byte-identical. Its
  S1 source is retained only as bootstrap history.
- Frozen Core 1 closes the Linux-amd64 development loop: the canonical lowerer,
  G1 frontend, Kernel validator, and migrator rebuild without S0, S1, assembly,
  Python, or another language toolchain. See
  [`compiler/FROZEN-CORE-1.md`](compiler/FROZEN-CORE-1.md).
- Host assembly tools remain optional construction and cross-check conveniences.
- The frozen compiler core is self-hosted. Full Kernel v1 schema semantics and
  structured diagnostics remain incomplete above that independent floor.
- The post-freeze canonical validator emits deterministic canonical diagnostic
  reports for every current rejection path while preserving the frozen
  validator and its trust-boundary hashes. Broad graph/encoding locations are
  implemented; entity/field path refinement remains a Kernel v1 gate.

See [`spec/architecture.md`](spec/architecture.md) and
[`spec/roadmap.md`](spec/roadmap.md) for the product proof sequence, and
[`bootstrap/README.md`](bootstrap/README.md) for the independent bootstrap.
The broader Seme–registry–Pulp interoperability direction is documented in
[`spec/software-commons.md`](spec/software-commons.md).

The first ordinary-project dogfood layer is the narrow
[`Provider Contract v1`](spec/provider-contract-v1.md) Go proof. It imports
package functions, performs an identity-addressed semantic rename, minimally
projects resolved occurrences, runs the native Go tests, re-imports, and proves
identity recovery. It validates the provider boundary, not general Go support.
